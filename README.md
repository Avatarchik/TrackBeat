# TrackBeat

TrackBeat is an Android application to extract human pulse information just from a video of the Human head. It extracts the motion of the head caused by rythmic cardiac activity and outputs the dominant frequency of this periodic-like motion. All this is optimized to work on a constrained computing platform of an Android Phone.
The app is a portable implementation of the algorithm described in the paper [Detecting pulse from head motions in video](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/papers/Balakrishnan_Detecting_Pulse_from_2013_CVPR_paper.pdf).
