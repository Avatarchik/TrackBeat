# TrackBeat
 TrackBeat is an Android application to extract human pulse information just from a video of the Human head. 
 It does this by measuring subtle head motion caused by the Newtonian reaction to the influx of blood at each 
 beat. The implemented method tracks features and performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to decompose 
 trajectories into a set of component motions. It then chooses the component that best corresponds to heartbeats 
 based on its temporal frequency spectrum. Finally, we analyze the motion projected to this component and identify 
 peaks of the trajectories, which corresponds to heartbeats. All this is optimized to work on a constrained 
 computing platform of an Android Phone.
 
 The app is a portable implementation of the algorithm described in the paper [Detecting pulse from head motions in video](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/papers/Balakrishnan_Detecting_Pulse_from_2013_CVPR_paper.pdf).
